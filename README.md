# L.E.A. - Libera El Arte

Web application designed to connect artists and gallery owners within a user-friendly environment. As a student initiative, I created this platform to facilitate the seamless display of art pieces, enabling gallery owners to easily contact artists for potential exhibitions or collaborations. Using cutting-edge technologies, including Python, Flask, REACT, AWS, Boto, and Bootstrap, ArtHub provides a visually appealing and efficient user experience for artists and gallery owners.
